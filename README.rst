Communicating Science Using the IPython Notebook
================================================

This is a repository for sample homework sets in physics/astrophysics
based on the `IPython Notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook>`_. 

To run these notebooks you will need:

* `Python 2.7.5 <http://python.org>`_
* `IPython 1.1.0 <http://ipython.org>`_
* `NumPy 1.7.1 <http://numpy.org>`_
* `Matplotlib 1.3 <http://matplotlib.org>`_
* `JSAnimation <http://github.com/jakevdp/JSAnimation>`_

Place the ``hw_problems.py`` file somewhere in your ``PYTHONPATH`` or
simply run the notebooks from the same directory.
